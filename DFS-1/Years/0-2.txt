Not much happened. Couple dwarves drowned, some more were killed by a werellama. Pretty rough stuff.

Otherwise, just increasing population. Starting on the tower with the library, and there is a tavern in the basement. Need to get it all cleaned up and stuff.

Oh, the fortress is called "Blackshaft", so thats a win.
